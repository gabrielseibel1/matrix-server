# Pi Matrix Conduit

Pi Matrix Conduit is a Matrix homeserver running [Conduit](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/conduit).

**Put simply, it is a computer running the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) communication protocol, so that people can connect to it and have a free, private, secure and decentralized instant messaaging experience!**

Please check the **usage tutorial** [here](docs/usage.md) to get ready to chat, or optionally, if you're already familiar with the Matrix protocol, simply join the server using your matrix client of choice :)

If you're feeling curious, you can find the **source code** for this project [here](https://github.com/gabrielseibel1/matrix-server).

After setting up your app, feel free to [contact me](https://matrix.to/#/@seibel:pimatrixconduit.xyz) to chat, and maybe consider dropping a donation tip! ;P
